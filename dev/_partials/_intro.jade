    h1 Hi, 
    p I am #[a(href="http://caradeuc.info") Benjamin Caradeuc].
    p This is my opinionated web starterkit. It is not meant to show the best practices but has been built for two main goals:
    ol
      li It helps me learn a lot by practicing some of the latest technologies I discovered and wanted to use one day
      li I will use it in the future for some of my personnal or professional projects.
    
    p It is meant to build one-page-apps and will maybe evolve for bigger projects, you can #[a(href="http://github.com/benavern/z-starterkit") find it on GitHub.]
    
    p These are the 3 main things I did want to know better :
    ul
      li
        a(href="#jade",data-scroll="jade") Jade
      li
        a(href="#sass",data-scroll="sass") Sass
      li
        a(href="#gulp",data-scroll="gulp") Gulp
