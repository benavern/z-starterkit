# Z Starter-Kit

__ IN PROGRESS __

## What's that?

Here is a starter-kit I built to learn some new features I am not used to yet.

* nodeJs && npm
* gulp
* sass
* jade


## Why?

I plan to use it soon for one of my personnal website.

I think it will be good for a one-page app.


## How To?

1. Clone/download the project
2. Install Ruby and Sass if you don't have it
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`
